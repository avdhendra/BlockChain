STORAGE LOCATION
STORAGE
->Permanent/Persistent Location
->Stored on the blockchain
->Expensive to write to
->Free to read from externally
->Can Only be modified by the contract that holds the values
outside the function we cannot change the storage value where the storage variable is define or in contract
->contains 2^256 slot maximum amount to store in the contract
->Each storage slot can hold 32 bytes
->Storage slots can store multiple values/variable


MEMORY
--> Temporary Location
--> Stored in RAM
--> Cheaper to write to
--> Mutable
--> Typically used for reference type
-->cleared after function execution
--> Memory -> Memory =reference

--> Memory->Storage=Copy
--> Storage->Memory=Copy
-->Storage->Storage=Copy


CALLDATA --> Calldata is location that is only used for function argument

--> Temporary Location
-->Only Store function argument
--> Behave similarly to memory
--> Can be cheaper than memory
--> Immutable
-->Useful for ensuring no intended copies are made






STACK
--> Temporary location
--> Internal Location not directly accessible(requires assembly)
--> Used for Small Local Variables
--> Store values needed for immediate Processing
-->Store function value types(uint ,int,string)
-->
-->
-->

LOGS ---> logs are transaction receipt
--> Associated with Transaction
--> Cannot be accessed by smart contracts
--> Where event data is stored
--> Cheap data structure
--> UseFul for returning information to the caller of a function
--> accessed off the blockchain
-->



CODE

--> Actual Code of the contract
--> Stored on the blockchain
-->Constant variable stored here
